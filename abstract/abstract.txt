Gravitational Impact of the Death Star on Endor and Earth-like planets

- Simon Tebeck ,Pranav Gupta

This study investigates the gravitational impacts of a hypothetical massive space station, akin to the Death Star from popular media, on nearby celestial bodies such as Earth and Endor. The core objective was to determine how such a massive artificial body could influence planetary orbits and surface gravitational forces, as well as the potential effects of its sudden disappearance. Utilizing Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and equations of motion, simulations were conducted to model the interactions between the Death Star, Earth, and Endor. The Velocity Verlet integration algorithm was implemented using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical calculations and data visualization. Results from the simulations indicated significant orbital perturbations for Endor when in proximity to the Death Star, while Earth showed relative orbital stability. The surface gravitational simulations revealed enhanced tidal forces on Endor due to the Death Star. The study also demonstrated noticeable destabilization in planetary orbits following the hypothetical sudden disappearance of the Death Star. These findings highlight the need for considering gravitational influences when introducing large masses into planetary systems. Future work may explore the addition of more bodies or variable orbital elements to enhance simulation realism.
