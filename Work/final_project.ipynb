    "The fictional universe of Star Wars introduces the concept of the Death Star, a massive space station with the capability to annihilate entire planets. Its resemblance to a natural moon raises intriguing questions about its gravitational impact on nearby celestial bodies, such as Endor, an Earth-like planet featured in the saga. This project aims to analyze the gravitational influence exerted by the Death Star on such planets, investigating potential changes in gravitational forces, tidal effects, and the consequences of its sudden destruction. Through the application of Newton’s Law of Gravity and the exploration of the three-body problem, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "# <center><font color=#46769B>Problem Statement</font></center>\n",
    "The Death Star, with its moon-like appearance, prompts an examination of its mass, gravitational strength, and the effects of its orbit around planets like Endor and Earth. This project will explore whether the Death Star's presence could lead to measurable changes in gravitational forces, create dangerous tides, or otherwise impact planetary stability and life. Additionally, it will consider the physical implications of the space station's sudden destruction, including potential destabilization of planetary orbits and the fallout of such an event."

    "\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition\n",
    "To conduct this analysis, critical parameters such as mass, volume, and distance need to be obtained. These will be sourced from canonical and fan-based literature, supplemented by estimations derived from film analysis. References will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Star Wars Databank (https://www.starwars.com/databank), \n",
    "Fan analyses and forums (e.g., TheForce.net, Wookieepedia), \n",
    "Peer-reviewed articles on similar fictional analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "The project will utilize the Velocity Verlet integration algorithm to account for energy conservation in our simulations. This method will help in accurately simulating the orbits of Endor and Earth (along with its moon) in scenarios with and without the Death Star’s influence. Gravitational forces on the surface of these planets will be calculated by analyzing the effects on probe masses distributed across a sphere, aiding in the assessment of potential tidal changes. The Python programming language, with its scientific libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib for 3D plotting, will be employed for simulation and visualization.\n",

By meticulously analyzing the gravitational effects of the Death Star on Endor and Earth-like planets, this study aims to contribute to the broader understanding of celestial mechanics and the impact of massive objects on planetary systems. The results are expected to spark interest not only among fans of the Star Wars franchise but also within the academic community, fostering a greater appreciation for the application of physics in speculative fiction.\n"
