# Submission Readme.md

This submission includes a Jupyter notebook that encapsulates the entire project workflow, from initial problem formulation to final results and discussions. Below is a guide to navigating and utilizing the notebook for review or further development.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The core of the submission is the `final_project.ipynb` file. This notebook is structured to provide a comprehensive view of the problem-solving process, integrating both the code and its documentation.

### Running the Notebook

1. **Background Section**: Begin by running the cell in the Background section. This cell imports all necessary libraries and defines the constants used throughout the analysis. It's crucial to run this cell first to ensure that subsequent cells execute without errors.

2. **Results and Discussion Section**: For each task outlined in the project, there is a dedicated code cell followed by a text cell. The code cell contains the Python code required to perform the analysis or generate the figures relevant to that task. Immediately following each code cell is a text cell that provides an interpretation of the results obtained from running the code. This structure is designed to closely integrate the analytical work with its contextual discussion, facilitating a seamless narrative flow.

### Running the Notebook

- **Backup file: If you find problem running the `final_project.ipynb`, there is `final_project.pdf` file as a backup of it.
